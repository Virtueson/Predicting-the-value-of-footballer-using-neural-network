## About
This project is fundamentally driven by the overarching objective of revolutionizing how football stakeholders assess the value of players. By intricately weaving together data scraping, processing, visualization, and neural network modeling, the study seeks to offer a sophisticated and data-driven framework for predicting the market values of footballers. The primary purpose is to address the limitations of traditional player valuation methods, which often rely on subjective judgments and historical transfer fees.
